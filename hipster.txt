I know it's been a hard task,
the things we ask of you.
You should know you're very special
for all the things you do.

One you should treasure, but not as a possession,
Who needs to be loved, not treated with aggression.
Her value is more than all the world's treasures,
Not just the sum of scale's unit measures.
